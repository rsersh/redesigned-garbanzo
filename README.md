This repository contains the current version of my website, rachel-tech.com.
Please note that this website is hosted on AWS and was written at the
command line in vim, using bootstrap, for challenge. It is not perfect;
however, it is intended to be mobile-ready.

Plans for a new site using Django is set for October. In the meantime,
this site will continue to be updated at the command line.

Thanks for stopping by. Please feel free to visit me on Twitter, @RachelRHunt.
