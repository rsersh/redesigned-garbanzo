          <br><p>I like to spend time exploring new things. For this reason, I have 
             experience with assembling PCs, as well as troubleshooting and data
             recovery. I am comfortable working in Linux, Unix, and Windows 
             environments. </p>
          <p>Oddly, I am also a licensed Amateur Radio operator, study the French 
             language, sew, read a lot, and own a registered dog walking business.</p>
          <p>The current iteration of my website is simple as the focus was on 1)
             setting up on AWS, and 2) writing a mobile-ready website from the 
             command line tool with just Bootstrap. <a href="https://www.rachel-tech.com">

          <p>Most recently, I have written a python web scraper to assist SF Brigade's Data
             Science Working Group. I will post the code on github in a few days.
